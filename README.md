# SVG-VexFlow font converter

## Status

Alpha

## Prerequisites

A local installation of NodeJS and the Node Package Manager (npm). 

## Installation

If Grunt is not installed globally on your computer, run `npm install -g grunt`. Then, from the root directory of the converter, run:

```
$ npm install -g bower grunt-cli
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
 
## Instructions

Type `grunt run` to launch a server on localhost:8000 and navigate to `localhost:8000/src/converter.html` in your browser. 
The output will be rendered to the DOM and can be copied from there.
See the JSDoc comments in `converter.html` for the converter options.
In order to use the new VexFlow font, save the generated output to a JavaScript file in the file system (for an example file, see `src/bravura_all.js`).
For a rendition of the generated `src/bravura_all.js` font with VexFlow, see `localhost:8000/src/glyphs.html` (the glyphs are quite small in order to fit them as a whole on a single HTML5 canvas; change `glyphs.html` to adjust everything as needed).

## Note

Depending on the size of the font file (preconfigured is the very large Bravura font), the conversion may temporarily freeze or even crash your browser. If you experience a browser crash, reduce the number of glyphs in `converter.html`.
