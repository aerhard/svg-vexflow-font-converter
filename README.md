# SVG-VexFlow font converter

## Status

Alpha

## Installation

From the root directory of the the converter, execute the following lines:

```
$ npm install -g bower grunt-cli
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
 
## Instructions

Change conversion options in `converter.html`. Type `grunt run` to launch a server on localhost:8000 and navigate to `localhost:8000/src/converter.html` in your browser. The output will be rendered to the DOM and can be copied from there.

## Note

Depending on the size of the font file (preconfigured is the very large Bravura font), the conversion may temporarily freeze or even crash your browser. If you experience a browser crash, reduce the number of glyphs in `converter.html`.
